# Modular Designs Piece by Piece 
Similar to Gridfinity, this website is for modular designs and guidelines for making said modular designs. These designs should be able to be 3D printed.

## Sizing and Making
To begin, we have a few sizing requirements. **To get this out of the way, all of the dimensions will be in mm, so should designs also be in mm.**
- Small:
  * 20 x 20 x 20 block
  * 18x18x18 working area (w/o tolerance)
  * 2mm
