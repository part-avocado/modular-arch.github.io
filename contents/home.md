# Modular Designs Piece by Piece 
Similar to Gridfinity, this website is for modular designs and guidelines for making said modular designs. These designs should be able to be 3D printed. We also will NOT host your 3D prints. You can use websites like Printables or Thingiverse to host your designs, and the links and other important details (such as images and description) should be written in this Google Form.

## Sizing and Making
To begin, we have a few sizing requirements. **To get this out of the way, all of the dimensions will be in mm, so should designs also be in mm.**
- Small:
  * 20x20x20 block
  * 18x18x18 working area (w/o tolerance)
  * 2x20 bars in a U shape for stacking (w/o tolerance) (TOP)
  *
